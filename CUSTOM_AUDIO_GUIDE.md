2. Scroll to **Audio Alert Settings**
3. Under **Custom Audio Files**, you'll see two upload sections:

## Quick Interval Presets

Click the preset buttons to quickly set your loop interval:

  -F "file=@/path/to/alert.mp3"

# Upload up sound
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/upload/audio/up \
  -F "file=@/path/to/recovery.mp3"
```

## File Management

### Where Files Are Stored
Your uploaded files are saved in:
```
webstatus/sounds/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system_down.{ext}  # Your alert sound
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system_up.{ext}    # Your recovery sound
```

### Replacing Files
Just upload a new file - it will replace the old one automatically!

### Backup Your Files
To backup your custom sounds:
```bash
cp sounds/system_down.* ~/backups/
cp sounds/system_up.* ~/backups/
```

### Restore Default Sounds
Delete your custom files and regenerate defaults:
```bash
cd sounds/
rm system_down.* system_up.*
say "The system is down" -o system_down.aiff
say "System restored" -o system_up.aiff
```

## Troubleshooting

**Upload button doesn't work:**
- Make sure you clicked "Choose File" first
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Verify file format is supported

**Sound doesn't play:**
- Check "Enable Audio Alerts" is checked
- Click "Test Audio" button
- Check console logs for errors
- Try a different audio format (WAV is most compatible)

**Sound quality is poor:**
- Use higher quality source file
- Avoid heavily compressed MP3s
- WAV format gives best quality

**File too large:**
- Compress your audio
- Trim to just 1-3 seconds
- Use MP3 instead of WAV
- Use online audio compressor

## Advanced: Format Conversion

If you need to convert formats:

**Using FFmpeg (Mac):**
```bash
# Install FFmpeg
brew install ffmpeg

# Convert to WAV
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 output.wav

# Convert to AIFF
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 output.aiff
```

**Using Online Tools:**
- [cloudconvert.com](https://cloudconvert.com/mp3-to-wav)
- [online-audio-converter.com](https://online-audio-converter.com/)

## Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ **Test before deploying** - Use "Test Audio" button
2. ‚úÖ **Keep backups** - Save original files
3. ‚úÖ **Start with short sounds** - 1-3 seconds ideal
4. ‚úÖ **Test volume** - Not too loud or too quiet
5. ‚úÖ **Use clear audio** - Avoid background noise
6. ‚úÖ **Consider your environment** - Office vs home use

## Legal Note

Make sure you have the right to use any audio you upload:
- ‚úÖ Your own recordings
- ‚úÖ Free sound effects (check license)
- ‚úÖ Open source audio
- ‚ùå Copyrighted music/sounds without permission
